# Dinner-and-a-movie

## Overview/Introduction
These are the labs for the React, Redux, and React Native classes. 

We're creating a web app that could be used for a movie theater that also serves food and drinks. The customer is able to pick a movie they want to see, select a showtime, and reserve seats in the theater on a seat map.

You've been provided a Node server using Express to serve data from a mongoDB database through a RESTful API. The server can be found under the "server" folder. Its README.md file has more info about that API.

In the labs, you'll create the client portion from scratch.

## Setup requirements
1. bash
1. mongo
1. Node and npm

## To run
cd server
npm run dev
This will run the client AND the server. Both are in watch mode so that if you make any changes to the source, it restarts.
